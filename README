Home Information Display

This is a simple home information display meant to be run in a browser
in kiosk mode on a 1080x1920 (rotated HD) display.  You will want to
customize the weather station and forecast locations in the "signcron"
file.

To install, you will need to set up cron to periodically run the signcron,
say every 10 minutes:

   */10 * * * * /var/www/html/sign1/signcron >/tmp/signcron.out 2>&1

Then you'll need to configure Apache to serve up the sign CGI:

   ScriptAlias /sign1/ /var/www/html/sign1/sign.cgi

Now restart Apache and go to /sign1/ in a web browser.  It should display
the information page.

Note that if you want to experiment with it, set up another copy as
"signtest" instead of "sign1", and you will get tracebacks with useful
information.  Otherwise, the sign will just display "Oops" and reload
every 60 seconds.  To set up the test version add this line and restart
Apache:

   ScriptAlias /signtest/ /var/www/html/signtest/sign.cgi
